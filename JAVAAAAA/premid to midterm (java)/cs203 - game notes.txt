- fill tree with nodes
- edge 1: start of connection (line)
- edge 2: end of connection (line)
- source: start of path to traverse
- destination: end of path in traversal
- table: shows '1' per connection, otherwise 0
- traversal: show traversal path (separated by commas)
- all nodes covered in path will change colors (e.g.  3 to 6)
